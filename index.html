            <h2>Software tester to be</h2>
            Currently working in Hotel Laterum at Pécs as a front desk receptionist,
            but with the current situation this position became really unstable, so I decided to participate in the
            program to broaden my future possibilities.
            I hope I will be able to keep and participate well during the classes.
